## Introduction

This repository is the first project of the master's degree in AI Engineering with [Profession AI](https://profession.ai), all the credits for the requests and idea go to this team.

TropicTaste Inc., a leading exotic fruit distributor, is looking to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the fruit classification process. The **goal** is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the type of fruit based on numerical features. The current exotic fruit classification process is manual and error-prone, making it inefficient and resource-intensive. The need for an automated and accurate system is crucial to streamline business operations and maintain high quality standards.

By implementing an automated classification model, TropicTaste Inc. will be able to:
- Improve Operational Efficiency: Automating classification will reduce the time and resources needed, increasing productivity.
- Reduce Human Error: A machine learning model will minimize classification errors, ensuring greater accuracy.
- Optimize Inventory: Accurate classification will allow for better inventory management, ensuring optimal storage conditions for each type of fruit.
- Increase Customer Satisfaction: Correct identification and classification of fruits will help maintain high quality standards, improving customer satisfaction.

Project Details:
- Dataset: Use of a dataset containing various numerical features of different exotic fruits.
- Algorithm: Implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification.
- Output: The model must correctly predict the type of fruit based on the data provided.

Project Requirements:
1. Loading and preprocessing of exotic fruit data.
2. Handling of any missing values, normalization and scaling of data.
3. Development and training of the KNN model.
4. Optimization of parameters to improve predictive accuracy.
5. Use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the generalization ability of the model.
6. Calculation of performance metrics, such as classification accuracy and error.
7. Create graphs to visualize and compare the model performance.
8. Analyze and interpret the results to identify areas for improvement.


## Dataset

This dataset contains the following variables:
- **Fruit**: The type of fruit. This is the target variable that we want to predict.
- **Weight** (g): The weight of the fruit in grams. Continuous variable.
- **Average diameter** (mm): The average diameter of the fruit in millimeters. Continuous variable.
- **Average length** (mm): The average length of the fruit in millimeters. Continuous variable.
- **Peel hardness** (1-10): The hardness of the fruit's peel on a scale of 1 to 10. Continuous variable.
- **Sweetness** (1-10): The sweetness of the fruit on a scale of 1 to 10. Continuous variable.
- **Acidity** (1-10): The acidity of the fruit on a scale of 1 to 10. Continuous variable.

# Exotic-Fruit-Classification
This repository is the fourth project of the master's degree in AI Engineering that I am following. It aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the type of fruit based on numerical features. I need to implement a feature engineering, EDA and KNN model to achieve this project, but I will try to add an interactive viz with pygwalker
